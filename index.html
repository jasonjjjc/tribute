          Robin was a legendary actor, never in the news for the wrong reasons, who brought love, laughter and life everywhere he went, except for at home. He is the quintessential paragon of a person who devoted years to the service of others by making people laugh until they cried, all whilst hiding demons and negativity privately held. <a id="tribute-link" target= "_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robin_Williams">Join us</a> as we explore the greatest comedian of the past 100 years and discover why he stands out amongst all the legends as the single most irreplacable persona that Hollywood ever produced.
